# Logo PNG Required

Please place the Academia Panobianco PNG logo file as `/public/logo.png`.

The logo should be:
- In PNG format
- Optimized for web use
- Transparent background preferred
- Approximately 120px wide for optimal display

Once you place the logo.png file in the public directory, the website will automatically use it in the header and footer instead of the SVG logo.

Current status: **LOGO FILE MISSING** - The website will show a broken image until the logo.png file is added.
